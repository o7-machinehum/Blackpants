# **Case**

In this folder you'll find files related to the case design for the WHY2025 badge.

> [!WARNING]  
> This design is currently being made and hasn't been finalized. It's being shared here in the spirit of open-source.

This design is also un-official as in: It's currently being worked on by people not part of Team:Badge. 

We're building off of the excellent work of Illyua.

The goal is to provide:

 * A minimalistic case. One that covers the batteries mostly, to provide a nice grip but leave most of the components exposed. This design should be easy to print (in bulk)
 * A full back-cover. One the covers the entire back, to provide the most robust back and provides a full "case". However this design might not be finished before WHY.

The files:

 * case.* -- The original work of Illyua, this is currently not being worked on, but is used as reference.
 * WHY Badge case.f3d -- The Fusion 360 file, that is currently being worked on.
