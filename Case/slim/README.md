# Slim case by flummer

In this folder you'll find files for a slim case design for the WHY2025 badge, that does not cover the sides og the PCBs, making it a little slimmer and also giving better access to the connections, especially the top expansions. This also exposes the spacer on the edge, which could allow for cool color combinations.

> [!WARNING]  
> This design hasn't been tested with the hardware in the final version, but a previous version have been test fitted and smaller adjustments made based on that.

This design is also un-official as in: It's been design by people not part of Team:Badge. 

It's designed in OpenSCAD and using simple changes in the bottom of the file, you can do a few modifications, like switch between the two part version or the single part edition.

The case is designed to be printed upright with a 0.4mm nozzle on an FDM printer, as that would result in 3 "walls" and a hence a fairly sturdy construction.

## Mounting on badge

The case uses M2 mounting hardware. 4x M2 brass heat set inserts and optionally 2 more for the 2 piece version to connect the two pieces together. The badge mounts to the case with 4x M2x12mm screws and optionally 2x M2x8 for connecting the two parts.

The wall thickness is pretty thin, so be careful when inserting the heat set inserts and don't use too much heat, as that will make it difficult to keep them aligned correctly.
