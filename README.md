# WHY2025

Dear WHY-minded people,

After months of tinkering, testing, and countless iterations, we’re excited to introduce the **WHY2025** Badge.
With the prototype phase officially complete, we’re now preparing for full production with our hardware partner in Shenzhen.
One final integration test remains, a last checkpoint before we move into manufacturing at scale.
Let us celebrate this huge milestone for our team, together.

What you see isn’t just another flashy circuit board, it is the heart of your **WHY2025** experience.
It’s the key to unlocking camp-wide experiences, playful mischief, and post-event projects for years to come.

Meet the Badge: Modular, Powerful, and Ready to Hack

At the core of the badge is a Compute Unit powered by the all-new Espressif ESP32-P4-32MB.
This little powerhouse is designed with after-camp life in mind.
We want you to take this unit, build your own Carrier Boards, and give it a second (or third) life in future projects.

Compute Unit 
ESP32-P4 – Your program’s main stage, fast and flexible.
Carrier Board 
ESP32-C6 – Dedicated for connectivity (Wi-Fi + Bluetooth)
Display – A crisp 4” square screen will be your window to the camp magic.
Frontplate – Currently undergoing the last round of refinement to make sure it both looks and feels great.
Keyboard – Coming with a little twist, more on that soon.
Sensor BMI270 – Measures motion and orientation (accelerometer + gyroscope).
Sensor BME690 – Measures air quality, temperature, humidity, and pressure.

Open Hardware: All schematics are available under the MIT license.

We’ll be posting more updates soon as we get closer to **WHY2025**. For now,
keep an eye on our channels and follow the progress as we bring this badge to life and into your hands.

With hacker spirit and warm regards,

Team:Badge
