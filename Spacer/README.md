# **Spacer**

In this folder you can find the files for the spacer production of the WHY2025 badge.
The SPACER_OD5_ID3_H3.stl is used for the camp.

## 3D Printing

The other STL files can be 3D-printed as Upgrade for your badge!
For best fit, set the layer height to **0.1 mm**.

There is also a two part design. This design has two parts. Part p1 (bottom) is 2.5mm thick for better keyboard key protrusion. Part p2 (top) is 3mm for display clearance. 

## Laser Cutting

Use **3 mm** material for laser cutting.

In the `lasercut` folder, there are three files:
- One file for a **full spacer**
- Two files for an **optimized two-part spacer**, designed for rapid production
